## Notes
This exercise will get your fingering going and also introduce you to non 4/4 bowing which some beginners find a real challenge.
You need to be able to play at 140bpm, playing blind while maintaining tonal quality.
*Also, don't forget to breathe, keep the shoulders, face relaxed.  Spine straight, head forward with the neck relaxed*

## Advanced playing
For those who like a challenge:
- Play 6 and then 12 notes per bow
- Play *blind*
- Take up to 200bpm (but play 6 notes per bow otherwise it gets nutty)
- Play full Scale down to M. and up to G\*
- Play in a 7:7 different (sampooran) raag scale as [Bhairon/Bhairav](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhairav_(raga))
