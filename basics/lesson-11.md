# Lesson 11 | SRGMP | Jhaptal (10)

Final variation of lesson 9 and 10.  This time it's 5 notes per bow.

*NB* This one is deceptively difficult despite the simple premise and that's because of the big jump between the last note in a cycle and the first note in the next cycle.  This is true for both saaj and vocals, so this will level you up quickly in both.
