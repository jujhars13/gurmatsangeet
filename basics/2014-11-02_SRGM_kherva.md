[Grab the recording here - in A#](https://soundcloud.com/jujhars13/2014-02-11-srgm-teentaal). Please note that this recording is in teentaal, I've since realised that this excercise is better served by Kherva Taal (8 beats) as you'll land back on the sum.  So please use that in your practice in place of teentaal.  I might replace the recording at some point.

- 8 Beat Cycle - Kherva.  Speed 80bpm all the way up to 200bpm
- 4 notes per bow
- Start slow and precicse, then when confident speed up
- Minimum 20 mins solid (contiguous and uninterrupted) practice 3x per week

*all the way up to top S\** and back down again*

## Notes
You need to be able to play at 140bpm, playing blind while maintaining tonal quality. 
*Also, don't forget to breathe, keep the shoulders, face relaxed.  Spine straight, head forward with the neck relaxed*

## Advanced playing
For those who like a challenge:
- Play 8 and then 16 notes per bow
- Play *blind*
- Take up to 200bpm (but play 8 notes per bow or use half bow otherwise it gets nutty)
- Play full Scale down to M. and up to G\*
- Play in a 7:7 different (sampooran) raag scale as [Bhairon/Bhairav](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhairav_(raga))
