*all the way up to top S\** and back down again*

## Notes
You need to be able to play at 140bpm, playing blind while maintaining tonal quality (unlike this recording, but I've got the wrong string for this key ;-) 
*Also, don't forget to breathe, keep the shoulders, face relaxed.  Spine straight, head forward with the neck relaxed*

## Advanced playing
For those who like a challenge:
- Play *blind*
- Take up to 200bpm (use half bows at that speed)
- Play full Scale down to M. and up to G\*
- Play in a 7:7 different (sampooran) raag scale as [Bhairon/Bhairav](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhairav_(raga))
