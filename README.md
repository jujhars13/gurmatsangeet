# Gurmat Sangeet Academy Lesson Notes


Lesson notes and extracts for the Birmingham Gurmat Sangeet Academy's beginner's classes in [Birmingham](http://www.gurmatsangeet.org/class-calendar/)

These have been put up on Github as a temporary store and the markdown format makes it easy for me to edit, amend and share.
